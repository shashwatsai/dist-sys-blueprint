# üõ†Ô∏è **Event-Driven Architecture (EDA), Event Sourcing, and CQRS**

---

## üìö **1. Overview**

This document explains the core concepts of:
- **Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)**: Asynchronous communication between decoupled services.
- **Event Sourcing**: Persisting all state changes as events for traceability and auditability.
- **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**: Separating read and write models for better scalability.
- **Delivery Semantics**: Understanding **at-most-once**, **at-least-once**, and **exactly-once** message delivery.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è **2. Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)**

### ‚úÖ **Definition**
EDA is an architectural pattern where:
- Services communicate asynchronously through **events**.
- **Producers** generate events, and **consumers** process them.
- **Event brokers** (Kafka, RabbitMQ) handle message routing.

### üõ†Ô∏è **Components**
1. **Event Producer:**
    - Generates and publishes events.
    - Example: A `Payment Service` emitting a `PaymentReceived` event.

2. **Event Broker:**
    - Routes events between producers and consumers.
    - Examples: Kafka, RabbitMQ, Pulsar.

3. **Event Consumer:**
    - Listens for and processes events.
    - Triggers actions, updates state, or calls external services.

### üí° **Real-Life Example: E-commerce Order System**
1. **Order Service:**
    - Emits an `OrderCreated` event.
2. **Inventory Service:**
    - Listens to the event ‚Üí Reserves items.
3. **Payment Service:**
    - Listens ‚Üí Initiates the payment process.

### üöÄ **Advantages**
- **Decoupling:** Independent service communication.
- **Scalability:** Consumers can scale independently.
- **Resilience:** Failures in one service do not affect others.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Challenges**
- **Event Ordering:** Maintaining the correct event sequence.
- **Idempotency:** Ensuring consumers handle duplicates safely.
- **Eventual Consistency:** Data consistency happens over time.

## üî• **3. Event Sourcing**

### ‚úÖ **Definition**
Event sourcing is a pattern where:
- **State changes** are stored as a series of immutable events.
- The current state is **reconstructed** by replaying the event history.

### üî• **Flow Diagram**
[ Events Store ] ---> [ Replay Events ] ---> [ Current State ]

### üí° **Real-Life Example: Bank Transactions**
1. **Events:**
    - `Deposit $100`
    - `Withdraw $50`
2. **Replaying Events:**
    - `$100 - $50 = $50` ‚Üí Current balance.

### üöÄ **Advantages**
- **Traceability:** Full audit trail of state changes.
- **Replayability:** State can be rebuilt at any point in time.
- **Scalability:** Append-only event logs scale efficiently.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Challenges**
- **Event Schema Evolution:** Managing backward compatibility.
- **Event Ordering:** Sequence of events matters.
- **Replay Latency:** Rebuilding state can be slow.

## üî• **4. CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**

### ‚úÖ **Definition**
CQRS is a design pattern that:
- Separates the **write model** (commands) from the **read model** (queries).
- Improves scalability by independently optimizing reads and writes.

### üî• **Flow Diagram**
[ Command (Write) ] ---> [ Write Model (DB) ] | |--> [ Event Stream ] | [ Query (Read) ] ---> [ Read Model (Cache or DB) ]

### üí° **Real-Life Example: E-commerce System**
- **Command Side:**
    - Writes orders and products to the database.
- **Query Side:**
    - Reads from **denormalized views** (Elasticsearch, Redis) for faster lookups.

### üöÄ **Advantages**
- **Performance:** Separates read and write workloads.
- **Scalability:** Independently scale read and write models.
- **Flexibility:** Query models can be optimized for different needs.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Challenges**
- **Data Synchronization:** Keeping read and write models in sync.
- **Complexity:** Maintaining separate models increases complexity.
- **Consistency Issues:** Read models might lag behind writes.

## üî• **5. Delivery Semantics**

### ‚úÖ **Message Delivery Semantics**
1. **At-most-once:**
    - **Message is delivered once or not at all**.
    - No retries.
    - **Risk:** Data loss.
    - **Use cases:**
        - Logging systems.
        - Metrics collection.

2. **At-least-once:**
    - **Message is delivered one or more times**.
    - **Possible duplicates**.
    - Retries on failure.
    - **Use cases:**
        - Payment processing (idempotency needed).
        - Event sourcing.

3. **Exactly-once:**
    - **Message is delivered only once**, even during retries.
    - Requires **idempotent processing**.
    - **Use cases:**
        - Financial transactions.
        - Order processing.

## üî• **6. Kafka Transactions Example**

### ‚úÖ **Producer with Exactly-Once Semantics**
```java
Properties props = new Properties();
props.put(ProducerConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG, "localhost:9092");
props.put(ProducerConfig.KEY_SERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, "org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer");
props.put(ProducerConfig.VALUE_SERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, "org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer");

// Kafka transaction settings
props.put(ProducerConfig.TRANSACTIONAL_ID_CONFIG, "txn-id-1");
props.put(ProducerConfig.ENABLE_IDEMPOTENCE_CONFIG, "true");
props.put(ProducerConfig.ACKS_CONFIG, "all");

KafkaProducer<String, String> producer = new KafkaProducer<>(props);
producer.initTransactions();

try {
    producer.beginTransaction();
    
    producer.send(new ProducerRecord<>("orders", "order-123", "Order placed"));
    producer.send(new ProducerRecord<>("payments", "payment-123", "Payment processed"));
    
    producer.commitTransaction();
    System.out.println("Transaction committed successfully.");
} catch (Exception e) {
    producer.abortTransaction();
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```
‚úÖ Consumer with read_committed:

```
Properties props = new Properties();
props.put(ConsumerConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG, "localhost:9092");
props.put(ConsumerConfig.GROUP_ID_CONFIG, "order-consumer");
props.put(ConsumerConfig.ISOLATION_LEVEL_CONFIG, "read_committed");

KafkaConsumer<String, String> consumer = new KafkaConsumer<>(props);
```

## üî• 7. Real-life Use Cases
### üí° Payment Processing System
EDA:

PaymentReceived ‚Üí Producer emits event.

OrderFulfilled ‚Üí Consumer listens and processes the order.

Event Sourcing:

Logs all payment events for auditing.

CQRS:

Write model: Main database (payments).

Read model: Cached balance view for fast lookups.

Delivery Semantics:

Exactly-once for consistent financial transactions.

## ‚úÖ 8. Key Takeaways
EDA: Asynchronous, decoupled, and scalable.

Event Sourcing: Persistent event logs for full traceability.

CQRS: Separating read and write models for better performance.

Delivery Semantics:

At-most-once: Risk of data loss.

At-least-once: Potential duplicates.

Exactly-once: Guaranteed consistency with idempotency.
